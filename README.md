# Serial Service Menu Tester

In looking for a nice basic console menu library for my various projects I came across a great project;

**Serial Service Menu** on Arduino Project Hub - https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/andreas_waldherr/serial-service-menu-91c5c1

I have taken the great example and code provided there and chopped it up a bit to suit my needs. This repository contains a simple tester program with some dummy data and functions to show how to use it.

## Coding Environment

I use [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) rather than the Arduino IDE.  I find it awesome in so many way, yes there is a little bit of learning to get yourself going, but once you have, you will never go back to the Arduino IDE. There are great guides on it elsewhere, gut you may want to have a look at the my *platformio.ini* file in this GitHub repository to see any specific settings I have made.
